    "Belepes" form is using green text and graphic button. Button changes
      on hover.

v0.3 Set up graphical menu
    The menu images are swapped over from the description fields,
      overriding the menu_item_link function in template.php, see:
    http://kevinhankens.com/content/dropdown-drupal-menus-accessibility-friendly-image-links
    http://chrisshattuck.com/blog/how-use-images-menu-items-drupal-simple-preprocessing-function
    The menu images are cut from the original graphics design, each text
      selected a rectangle 1 pixel bigger each direction,
      then saved as transparent background PNG,
      only 'Save res' ticked in settings, Compression level set to 5.

v0.2 Set up header
    The logo is set up by using Drupal settings for logo.
    The header image itself is the background of the logo,
      so Z-order is always OK.

v0.1 Set up 3-column, flex design.
		Use Zen to create the theme.
