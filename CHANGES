- Set up graphical menu
    The menu images are swapped over from the description fields,
      overriding the menu_item_link function in template.php, see:

v0.2 Set up header
    The logo is set up by using Drupal settings for logo.
    The header image itself is the background of the logo,
      so Z-order is always OK.

v0.1 Set up 3-column, flex design.
		Use Zen to create the theme.
